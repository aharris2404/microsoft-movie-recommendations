    "1. According to industry stabndards, 70% of movies lose money. It is expected that 30% of movies made will recoup the loses from the other 70%. Therefore, Microsoft should maximize revenue potential, and expected to lose money most of the time.\n",
    "2. As a new entrant, the box office matters. Box Office Revenue generates buzz. Profitability doesn't.\n"
