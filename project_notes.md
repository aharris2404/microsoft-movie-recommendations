# Project 1 Notes

## Defining Success

Q: How are we defining success?

### Methodology
* ROI good, but more about maximizing total profit than about maximizing rate (Microsoft cares more about making 100 mil on a 200 mil investment than making 5 on a 1 investment)
* Total revenue also good because they might care more about +$500m-$450m than +$200m-100m (making a big splash)
* Social media buzz, box office hit, and critical success less important
* Social media/box office arguably tracked anyway by revenue/ROI
* Critical success - who cares? Marvel movies are trash - make billions
* Other options: user reviews, # of movies made, quality of actors/directors/producers brought on (hard to measure)

### Data Sources
* Do we want to unzip? prob not
* Additional places for data?
