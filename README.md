## Goals

The goals of this project were to offer recommendations to Microsoft with the idea of swinging big. Profit is important, but for a large company like Microsoft which can afford to spend and would be a new player in the film industry, the most important thing is to make a big splash - e.g. lots of revenue and lots of buzz.

We primarily looked at choice of genre as a way to maximize revenue and buzz.
